# 🛡️ AI-Powered UPI Fraud Detection System
Real-Time Machine Learning Risk Scoring • Behavioural Analysis • Fraud Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This project is a complete end-to-end UPI Fraud Detection System designed to mimic real-world fraud engines used by banks and payment apps. It analyzes transaction behavior, timing, device changes, and historical frequency to classify transactions as ALLOW, FLAG, or BLOCK.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
### Backend
- Python 3
- Flask
- SQLite
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

### Frontend
- HTML5
- Bootstrap 5
- Bootstrap Icons
- Jinja2
- Chart.js

### Machine Learning
- RandomForestClassifier
- OneHotEncoder + ColumnTransformer
- Pipeline-based preprocessing
- Synthetic dataset (20,000+ UPI transactions)

## 🎯 Purpose
To demonstrate how AI can detect fraud using:
- Behavioral analysis
- Timing & frequency patterns
- Device anomalies
- Receiver risk profiling
- ML-based risk scoring

## ⭐ Key Features
- Fraud prediction engine
- Real-time dashboard
- SQLite transaction logging
- API endpoint for prediction
- Beautiful responsive UI

## 🧠 Model Details
### Model Used
RandomForestClassifier (Scikit-Learn)

### Model Parameters
```
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=150,
    max_depth=None,
    random_state=42,
    class_weight="balanced"
)
```

### Why Random Forest?
- Handles mixed categorical + numeric data
- Detects nonlinear fraud patterns
- Robust for imbalanced data
- Stable and widely used in fintech

## 📊 Metrics Used
### 1. Confusion Matrix
- TP, TN, FP, FN breakdown

### 2. Classification Report
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

### 3. ROC-AUC Score
Industry standard for fraud detection:
```
roc_auc_score(y_test, y_proba)
```

## 🏗 Architecture
```
User Input → Flask Backend → ML Model → Rule Engine → SQLite Logging → Analytics Dashboard
```
